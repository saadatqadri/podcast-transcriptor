0:00:27         and just one more thing the how I built this team is taking a little time off for the holidays but before we head out we're going to put a bonus episode in your queue this Thursday so be on the lookout for a special live recording with me and Arthur Blank co-founder of the Home Depot for now he's got one of our very favorites from the archives in Troy
0:00:49         my favorite quotes is if you want to understand entrepreneur study the juvenile delinquent cuz it's cuz they're saying you know this sucks I'm going to do it my own way that's what the entrepreneur. They just say this is wrong I'm going to do at this other way and that's the fun part of business actually
0:01:10         I love breaking the rules
0:01:18         from NPR how I built this show that innovators entrepreneurs idealist at the stories behind the movements they built
0:01:30         I got rosin on Today Show how even should I went from pounding hot metal in a converted Chicken Coop to founding the outdoor clothing brand Patagonia and why today he says he does not want your money
0:01:49         Devon Kennard isn't that kind of entrepreneur who's going to wow you with a PowerPoint presentation or a Snappy elevator pitch he's basically a surfer a kayaker in a mountain climber who sort of stumbled into the role of businessman and he's also pretty how can I say this eccentric but the in the best possible way if I've never had any interest in becoming rich he is actively work to slow down patagonia's growth in profit margins and yet despite his best efforts to keep it small this little clothing company he started 50 years ago has turned into a huge business well I never intended to start a business it's just I just have this Knack that every time I look at a product I look at it and I think you know I can make something better than it could be better so every time we went climbing we come back with ideas on how to improve the climbing gear which is very crude in those days and so you know I became
0:02:48         blacksmiths I've taught myself blacksmithing so that I could make some of the climbing Hardware that I thought would be better than what's available you literally like pounding hot pictures of metal into shape that's exactly right you know doing in my parents backyard and my father help me convert a chicken coop into it a little shop so well as making do you know pitons metal spikes that you pound in the cracks and I was making the carabiners of snap planks and hard Goods like that yeah cuz I mean what it is that has huge commercial Enterprise right now they were probably 250 climbers in the country and all the gear came from Europe and and it was pretty poor quality like the pitons were made to be used once because he Europeans looks at climbing is Conquering mountains and you just leave all the gear in place to make it easier for the next group and
0:03:48         you were brought up kind of the philosophy of John Muir and an author oh and we felt like nature should be left alone and you should do a climate but leave the thing behind and so I made pitons out of better materials that can be put in and take it out and used over and over again it was a lesson in and quality I think because the European towns are selling for $0.15 a piece and mine word dollar and a half and I guess you did this for like 10 or 10 or so years yeah what are you doing well well yeah we had 80% of the market and any like it she had no intention of ever making it that right no not at all I didn't respect businessman I have no interest in business whatsoever I was a Craftsman but you know we were making hardly any money I mean we're making about 1% profit at the end of the year we were basically paying ourselves by the hour so how did you guys Branch out from from climbing gear 2 clothing
0:04:49         well I was on a climbing trip to Scotland in the winter I was walking by some shopping I saw a rugby shirt in the window and I thought that's pretty cool as you know I was real colorful head blue and red and yellow on made really tough so I thought it might just make a really great shirt for a climbing you know the caller kind of keeps a gear Sling from cutting into your neck and you know at that time Active Sportswear for men was basically grey sweatshirts and sweatpants that was at her in Mendon. We're eating colorful and so I started wearing this climbing and everybody was gone wow where'd you get that so it was kind of the lights came on I thought well maybe how to import a few of these from England and see if she'll sell I'm sure enough they sold and then I started making some climbing shorts and pants and one thing led to another and I realize a lot more profitable than making p x how did you come up with the name Patagonia
0:05:46         well in 68 I did a six-month long trip from California down to South America and we drove in and served all the way down to Coast down to Lima and then sold a surfboards and then climb volcanoes down at southern Chile and skeet off of them and I kind of fell in love with that area of Patagonia you know in those days nobody even knew what Patagonia was I mean, like Timbuk2 you know how many people know where Timbuktu is and so I decided to call it Patagonia because I wanted to make clothing for those kind of conditions you know Corn Flakes super high winds cold crazy temperatures change in weather exactly what is it like you did not know anything about clothing here right I didn't know anything about closing I learned everything bites kind of get an idea immediately take a step for it
0:06:43         and see how that feels if it feels good I take another step and feels bad I stepped back you know it's different than people with a scientific view or they think everything out to the Instagram before they make them sorry I learn by just doing you know one of the first products we met was a pair of climbing shorts and I made the pattern for it I knew nothing about pattern-making I just took a pair of shorts the part and I kind of looked at it and I and I wanted you to make a really tough pair of shorts so I use canvas from outdoor furniture or something and I had this Korean woman working for me and she had to show it on a walking foot machine which is the kind of sewing machine to use for sewing leather cuz of the fabric was so thicken
0:07:29         and when she was done with him she stood him up they stood straight up so we need them stand up shorts and you know it took about 15 but we still make those shorts but in our course not as heavy as they were it seems like your main motivation was to just make stuff that you would want to wear and use yourself but love nobody's making stuff good enough and you were just sort of like I guess I have to break it yeah you know I I I used to do every conceivable Sport and then the people that work for me where all sports people so we knew what we wanted you know what I heard somebody say that if you wait for the customer to tell you what to do you're too late so we were our own customer and I think that was a secret of coming out with products that a lot of products people didn't even know they they want it or need it when you start to do this and you had to hire employees and you have to form a company and you have to
0:08:29         payroll like the nectar to scare you yeah yeah that was pretty scary and we made a lot of mistakes and in fact we were so successful in the late eighties and stuff that we were growing too fast we're going to 50% a year and you can't do that for very long before you run out of money basically on retained earnings you can't do that and so we were all wrapped up to grow 50% and we only grew 25 or something which doesn't sound bad but when you build all the inventory for for that and you don't make it it's pretty rough and then there was a recession down and and the banks wouldn't give us any more money in fact I had to lay people off which was really hard because we're family style business we knew everybody working there and I was really tough at moments during those periods Dobson dance where you thought you had to go
0:09:29         Whitetail absolutely we didn't know where they were going to make it or not we couldn't get any loans from anybody at my account and introduced me to some Mafia guys who I owe me some money at 18% interest which I turned down but what saved us is we got some personal loans from some friends and pretty much fired some management that got us in this problem and turn things around
0:09:56         why do you think it happened was it just bad luck was it just the economy or was it was there a strategy that didn't align with we were just going for growth you know not saying no it's just gross can creep up on you I mean we were just opening more more dealers or Opening Our Own retail stores you know nothing goes forever and in fact that's why the pastor of business grow so fast. I saw also and so once we got out of this we decided to put ourselves on a growth program so that we would be in business a hundred years from now so all the decisions then on were made as if we're going to be here a hundred years from now and so was slowing down the girl saying no to a lot of opportunities and just being more responsible like like how it just
0:10:47         I don't prime the pump I don't we don't advertise and Vanity Fair to get new customers or something we have in fact our advertising budget is one-half of 1% of sales and so I wait for the customer to tell us how much to make one year will growth support for this podcast in the following message come from T-Mobile for business T-Mobile and Sprint are joining forces building a 5G network with more bandwidth tailored for businesses of all sizes and Nationwide it's a network design to power businesses with their reach and reliability they need to keep employees and office is connected and the capacity to handle business as it changes in the future more at T-Mobile for business.com tremendous and personalize your suit just the way you wanted this week how I built this with nerves can get any premium indochino suit for 55% off plus free shipping just go to indochino.com or any indochino showroom and use code

0:11:54         yes how I built this from NPR a guy Roz took that Patagonia came of that tough. In the early 1990s Avon and his team started to focus Less on growing and more I just lasting is a company and they start to do things like use more environmentally friendly material and they also started to do something weird for a business instead of telling customers to buy their stuff Patagonia kind of told them not to ya believe that this company is the resource that I have and that I should use that resource to show a different way of doing business in fact we now have the largest garment repair center in North America Will Repair every single piece of Patagonia matter how old it is and death play in fact we've got a truck that's going around the country repairing people's clothes no matter whether they're Patagonia or not and then we're trying to teach people that you don't throw things away
0:12:54         repair them and then we committed ourselves to owning the product forever so when we sell you a jacket we still own it if you get overweight or tired of the color of whatever you want to get rid of it will help you sell it to somebody else if it breaks down will fix it if it's finally you know completely shot you give it back to us and we'll recycle it into more garments and so it forces us to use fibers that can be recycled it forces us to design a jacket that you can replace a zipper cuz it's very easy to design one where you can't replace a zipper is change the whole way we do business like what about you how many fries I all my stuff is years and years old I'm sitting here talking to you and my pants are probably seven or eight years old my shirt is probably the same but you know it's it's kind of interesting
0:13:54         am I went to a garage sale in Jackson Hole recently in and there was a jacket that we made about 10 years ago and it was purple man's great shape the woman wanted $3 for it so he offered her 15 she took it then he went on eBay and a guy from Japan said hey I like to buy that jacket how much you want for it all you don't make me an offering it so all of how about 750 so I actually listen to keep their value which is pretty amazing and that mean the thing is like a new Patagonia jacket is not exactly none of your stuff yes I mean we have a lifetime guarantee and we can't make things cheaply we're trying to make the very very highest quality we we can then lets you know it's like organic food is cost more than regular food as it should and it causes you no less harm the environment and so let people pay for that and I'm not interested
0:14:54         and coming out with a line of inexpensive clothes you know it's kind of like eating meat I eat meat but I eat a tiny little bit at a time I don't need a 16 oz porterhouse and I think with clothing we're telling people look sick twice if you're going to buy a jack at the skin by one that you can also wear over your suit coat and New York City in a rainstorm so that doesn't sit in the closet 9 months a year and and so on own few or things but really good thanks but it's if Harley still conflicted over this idea that even with all the responsible things you do you are still part of the consumer world yeah we certainly are yeah and that's why we try to kind of put a spin on it but you don't tell me our customers to think twice before they buy anything not just our product but anything if you have
0:15:50         no college degree for me to have a business degree you're not like you are not a businessman but you are I mean you became one and a friend that you can call yourself a relaxing businessman but do you feel uncomfortable with that title no not at all because I think what I did is once I decided that was a businessman I decided to really study up on it I studied every book I could on Japanese management styles and Scandinavian businesses and cuz I thought there had to be a different way of doing business and I still wanted only work for part of the Year myself you know I I take off from June until November I'm gone I got a place in Jackson Hole and I go fishing every day and I call in maybe three times in the 5 months then I'm gone people know that if the wear house burns down don't call me what can I do you know what to do
0:16:50         how are you able to do that you know what I heard a great thing on NPR actually bought this woman at Stanford studies ants and she said that he's don't have they don't have bosses and everyone knows what their job is and they get their job done and compare that with dictatorships and so a lot of companies are top-down management and it takes a tremendous amount of effort to run those so what we decided to do is just hire motivated young independent people and leave me alone and let me know I wrote a book called let my people go surfing and it's all about we have a policy that when the surf comes up drop work and you go surfing I don't care when you work as long as the job gets done and you know I've had another companies come to me as hell I love that idea I think I'm going to do it in my company I said forget it you will fail
0:17:46         because you have to start with a very first person you hire and I've had psychologists study or our employees and they said I got to tell you that your employees are most independent I've ever seen any company in fact they're so independent unemployable anywhere else you guys were doing maternal and paternal leave people can take an infant to daycare for the staff and flexible work schedule that we even to this day today are still not that common and in all companies you're doing this 40 years ago will you be one of them for kids with us at work you know I'll go put them in a cardboard box on your desk in
0:18:36         and that work for a while but then got some screamers and so my wife and I started and we didn't want to just somebody just babysitting these kids you know we recognize that 025 is the most important learning time of a person's life and so it's not a babysitting service it the kids are come out of our company or the best product that comes out not once been in prison yet all these things cost the company money
0:19:11         well if we're going to be here a hundred years so you know it's we're not going to sell out we're not going to go public and so it's good business I mean I have probably 70% women work for me I have women and all upper management
0:19:27         and I don't want to lose him where did you mean a lot of the people that we talked to on the show are motivated by you know when to change an industry or change the way business is done or to change the world or to make money and I think everybody would agree that they wanted to make money that isn't you and where did you and where do you find the motivation to make this company Ramen Thrive well you know what my favorite quotes is if you want to understand entrepreneur study the juvenile delinquent
0:20:01         is there a saying you know this sucks I'm going to do it my own way and I have a background of
0:20:08         as always the shortest guy around I could play sports pretty well you know team sports but when it came time for actual game I would fumble the ball and I realize that the best thing to do is invent your own sports then you can always be a winner and so that's what the entrepreneur does they just say this is wrong I'm going to do at this other way and if you want to be successful in business you don't go up against Coca-Cola and these big companies are they'll kill you you just do it differently you figure out something that no one else has thought about and you do it at totally different way then and so breaking the rules you have to be creative and that's the fun part of this actually I love breaking the rules by certain rules writing a philosophy that I can guide you well I've been a student I believe in the more you know the less you
0:21:08         I've been fishing fly fishing with one fly in one type of fly in different sizes
0:21:16         it has limited myself to that for a whole year and I've caught more fish than I've ever caught in my life I realize that all of these hundreds of thousands of different fly patterns and different colors shapes and everything are totally unnecessary you can replace all of that with knowledge and technique as it's a good lesson for me and you try to fix the hardest thing in the world to simplify your life cuz everything pulls you to be more and more complex and so I think what I learned from fly fishing is that if we have to either were forced or we decide to go to a more simple life is not going to be an impoverished life
0:21:58         it's going to be really rich
0:22:04         Russian Art under a Patagonia he never took a penny of investment by the way salons 100% of the company and because of that the company doesn't make their numbers public so despite the fact that endless growth may not be Yvonne shanard sing Patagonia reportedly did it three quarters of a billion dollars in sales last year their best year ever

0:24:56         after a night of performance prices that for now most of the people who are buying fire drops have cold or sore throat and that means it's three years in the company still has a small problem we're seasonal business in summer time is a slow time for cold and sore throat and so it becomes a challenge to figure out how to manage cash flow properly that's Brett Johnson when we last heard from him fire drops were selling in about 15 stores and just about to break even today Brett says fire drops are in 75 stores across the country the business is now turning a profit and just a few weeks ago with his day job to work on fire drops full-time
